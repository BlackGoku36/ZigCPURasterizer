A CPU Rasterizer written in Zig during my free time for fun and to learn.

Checkout `Computer Graphics from Scratch` section on: https://blackgoku36.github.io/BG36Notes/

If I remember correctly, I got spot model from: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/

## BUILD INSRTUCTIONS
